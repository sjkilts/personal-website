      - project:  |
                  rulez sublimation print on metal 16x20"
      - update:   |
                  use code to process all your <img> without the messy links everywhere
                  should be able to type the image handling url once, not every time
      - update:   |
                  use the hours data from your .yml to process and track your time
                  should be real easy with python, may be managable with liquid
