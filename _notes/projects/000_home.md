yakk-maxx
	the dyneema cord you have is plenty strong enough
  	priority:
      - get psyched
      
notes
	attempting to streamline notes.yml / notes.md
    currently renders pretty well
    at the point where input is the issue
    need something cleaner for daily use
    here we are
    goal:
    	- use prose as a clean way to input and manage notes
        - display easy to reference notes on webpage 
    currently:
    	- have metadata set up in config that mirrors notes.yml
        - using prose to manage notes/projects
        - should be able to have one page per project
        - grab metadata in the same way as notes.yml
        - consolidate notes for the project
    next:
    	- proof of concept pulling note and project data / todos
        - if successful
        - import remaining projects, notes
    missing anything?
