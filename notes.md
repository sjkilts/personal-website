            yosar was climbers self regulating alongside NPS
      text: |
            NPS is forest cops
      text: |
            scenarios permitting makes some sense:
            high risk/alpine
            incliment weather/alipine
            not truly applicable to el cap 
            perhaps in extreme scenarios which weren't planned for
            which is the point of a rescue system
            otherwise undue buracracy increasing regulation on public land
      text: |
            NPS is using skewed data 
            and international catastrophe                 
            to push a police state agenda
      text: |
            this seems like an attempt to control and gather data
            specifically isolates a specific user group 
            adds additional cost and complication which primarily impacts low income and minority users
            who knows what regulations climbers or others who are respectfully exploring the outdoors could eventually face
            |
            next up: wear a satellite beacon registered with NPS, nasa and SPACEX
            must be worn at all times on public land or face fines and or imprisonment
            it's only $1700 for the tracker and the required service is $129.99 a month forever!
      text: |
            based on nothing but intuition it seems likely that influential people in
            NPS, YOSAR and popular Yosemite climbing access groups are seeing benifits from this beyond the impact to everyday climbers
            |
            at best it's a lazy way to get other people do do their work for them,
            while charging us for the privlidge 
            |
            more negative use cases involve data collection
            used for marketing, advertising, funding
            even potentially selling future permits for gatekeeping amounts of money
            (a permit costs 15,000 euro to climb popular routes on Mont Blanc in 2022, 
            this is not resolving their rescue problem caused by undereducated, overconfident people)
      text: |
            a likely outcome for this permit system is increasing popularity of big in-a-day climbs
            this style of climbing is incredibly risky, even when undertaken by pro-level climbers
            a large increase in popularity of speed climbing has potentially huge negative implications
            huge future potential for speed climbing to become popular with under or mis-educated masses 
            this could cause a much larger strain on rescue resources than big wall climbing ever has
