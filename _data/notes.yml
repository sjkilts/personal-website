                  use code to process all your <img> without the messy links everywhere
                  should be able to type the image handling url once, not every time

                  use the hours data from your .yml to process and track your time
                  should be real easy with python, may be managable with liquid

                 yosar was climbers self regulating alongside NPS
      - content: |
                 NPS is forest cops
      - content: |
                 scenarios permitting makes some sense:
                 high risk/alpine
                 incliment weather/alipine
                 not truly applicable to el cap 
                 perhaps in extreme scenarios which weren't planned for
                 which is the point of a rescue system
                 otherwise undue buracracy increasing regulation on public land
      - content: |
                 NPS is using skewed data 
                 and international catastrophe                 
                 to push a police state agenda
      - content: |
                 this seems like an attempt to control and gather data
                 specifically isolates a specific user group 
                 adds additional cost and complication which primarily impacts low income and minority users
                 who knows what regulations climbers or others who are respectfully exploring the outdoors could eventually face
                 |
                 next up: wear a satellite beacon registered with NPS, nasa and SPACEX
                 must be worn at all times on public land or face fines and or imprisonment
                 it's only $1700 for the tracker and the required service is $129.99 a month forever!
      - content: |
                 based on nothing but intuition it seems likely that influential people in
                 NPS, YOSAR and popular Yosemite climbing access groups are seeing benifits from this beyond the impact to everyday climbers
