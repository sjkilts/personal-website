>meaner than  
your mom is    
as hard as possibility   
pythagoras spouts spiritually  
bouts of infinite divinity  
worked on angles  
but got angels  
sometimes its that    
stop and breathe  
like you meant to see  
like you know it we  
be all you knead   
listen glean glisten   
now its never  
really missing  
if we fed  
have time to sit an  
gracious tidings blessed be  
love for this reality  
>  
>got to be  
what hot like steam    
cooler cucumber  
veggie green scene   
what trees see is whats  
real it seems  
ride for we  
fuck with my people  
waters birds all that's green    
if you separate you'll see  
that subjective reality  
could've sent it coming  
you been known these things   
like there's no i in breathe  
an you leader is a fiend  
construct
crumpled up    
tell me what that mean  
yes y'all kill each other  
we done split the scene      
turtle shell covers  
we one not other  
not too old to see    
love is  
obviously  
>  
>you from me so why you me  
and hawai'i cant breathe  
yall false deities  
down with land seize  
that slave squeeze  
what save means (what save means?!)  
end yo slave dreams  
leave you spent  
dry heave  
big flame  
burnt trees    
caugh wheeze  
and plus   
they gave em  
broken knees  
bonus steeze  
white rabbits  
colored antifreeze  
even heard em say  
thank you, please

>who says you  
about them too?  
spot it an we dodge it  
manifest your thoughts    
hear you      
come across crude  
pretty words not true   
what rude  
saw it comin out the blue  
stay up.  
shine bright truth    
fast as light, you.  
low, slow, clean. go.  
lern to skirt the conflict  
while you pack n light your soul  
see skull by mole garden  
we bloom grow  
fractal-like from atom  
with a holographic soul  
yo  
roots and leaves  
from your ancestry  
is the dust we breathe  
but you already know
