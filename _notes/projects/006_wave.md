      - check on e-ink license plate with people  
      - smart grant  
      - vidya game make an outline, storyline, concepts etc see if your writer frien is interested in helping

    todo: |
      - smart grant  
      - model platform w/drone parts  
      - define and code movement software based on skate, snow, surf, ski  
      - consider traditional load carrying ideas ie. dogsled, kayak, skid etc  
      - build a working protoype drone you can fly with pressure from your hand  
      - make it tinyyy  
      - sell it as a modern tech deck  
      - pile money  
      - research ion drive  
      - research sound-based power  
      - make a toy that does that  
      - repeat the sell and profit steps  
      - make it bigger  
      - fly a cadillac  
      - fly your cadillac to your floating rainforest moss island with the bear and falcon  
      - feel accomplished and probably chill

    todo: |
      - look at grant, validate dates & requirements  
      - e-ink license plate idea  
      - platform proof of concept  
      - research ion drive feasibility  
      - platform loads & power requirements  
      - future potential to use platform for automotive, recreation, industry use

    note:     |
      - irl we really want the ion drive to work in atmosphere, and we need battery stuff to change dramatically  
      - the sound-based battery system could work very well if we can get it out of the ocean / scale  
      - am not a physicist so actually working on that myself is not really ideal?  
      - will, if necessary. go to school?  would be better to have money to throw at physicists  
      - something like the SMART grant would help  
      - two ideas  
      - 1 not that useful maybe but e-ink license plate. only legal in three states, but new. should be an easy sell  
      - 2 floating load delivery platform proof of concept  
      - - basically just a flat drone to push boxes around on  
      - - could be self-guided eventually, main goal is have it respond to touch input  
      - - so push on a side, it goes that direction  
      - - compensates automatically to not tip when you push, etc.  
      - - trying to build a scale model proof of concept, to move a scale load in the way a forklift typically does  
      - - this inital product would then be roughly a forklift the size of a pallet, hopefully charged long enough to unload a truck  
      - - remote user input to raise a load up into storage safely as an individual  
      - - powered battery base that responds to the same usable touch input so the platform can charge in use unless flying  
      - * e-ink license plate could probably be kickstarted with a render  
      - - - this is a great side project that could mean big money  
      - - - see if people are excited.  if an industrial designer chose to invest a little time this could happen quick  
      - * side scroller game could be a fun way to build interest and make some side money  
      - - start with jank battery powered drone hoverboard  
      - - work up to ion drive, infinite power  
      - - add in other cool things like the flying car, bike, home etc.  
      - - like alto meets hill climb  
      - - minimal ads, like alto  
      - - store with merch etc  
      - - early release a hoverboard through the game one day ;)  
      - * something something floating carbon fiber cadillac luxury camper home  
      - - like, its a whole new world baby  
      - have enough knowledge to build some version of the drone thing, have an industrial designer to help with packaging  
      - could probably get both of those ideas done without too much third party input?  
      - we need third party input for the cool stuff.    
      - if we can fund a feasibility report from MIT guys about the ion drive and sound based battery  
      - that would be cool and tell us enough to either get big funding or sit on the idea  
      -  
      - blah blah future this could be a floating platform that cleans the air and is powered by sound what do you want  
      - yes, flying surfboard  
      - yes, flying car  
      - your jetsons house is still kinda dumb  
      - yes, floating moss hut
