      cover letter - frontend engineer  
        
      Hello,  
        
        
      My name is Scott Kilts.  A detail-oriented frontend engineer working in Jekyll, Markdown, JavaScript and Sass.  Excited about writing clean, minimal code.  I would be happy to implement your new pages.  
        
      Here is a Jekyll site I worked on recently: https://tenantsrights.github.io/tacoma/  
        
      Thanks for your time.  I look forward to hearing from you,  
        
        
      Scott Kilts
