          data suggests (mt blanc) that permits may actually hurt overall rescue numbers
          not gatekeeping access greatly increases the likelyhood of climbers helping each other
          this is common, and not accurately reported or reflected in any data
          adding any cost cap or registration hoop to jump through will restrict people
          are multi-day big-wall climbers an actual problem?
          compared to other user groups, my biased personal experience suggests the opposite
          |
          yosar was climbers self regulating alongside NPS
          |
          NPS is forest cops
          |
          scenarios permitting makes some sense:
          high risk/alpine
          incliment weather/alipine
          not truly applicable to el cap 
          perhaps in extreme scenarios which weren't planned for
          which is the point of a rescue system
          otherwise undue buracracy increasing regulation on public land
          |
          NPS is using skewed data 
          and international catastrophe                 
          to push a police state agenda
          |
          this seems like an attempt to control and gather data
          specifically isolates a specific user group 
          adds additional cost and complication which primarily impacts low income and minority users
          who knows what regulations climbers or others who are respectfully exploring the outdoors could eventually face
          |
          next up: wear a satellite beacon registered with NPS, nasa and SPACEX
          must be worn at all times on public land or face fines and or imprisonment
          it's only $1700 for the tracker and the required service is $129.99 a month forever!
          |
          based on nothing but intuition it seems likely that influential people in
          NPS, YOSAR and popular Yosemite climbing access groups are seeing benifits from this beyond the impact to everyday climbers
          |
          at best it's a lazy way to get other people do do their work for them,
          while charging us for the privlidge 
          |
          more negative use cases involve data collection
          used for marketing, advertising, funding
          even potentially selling future permits for gatekeeping amounts of money
          (a permit costs 15,000 euro to climb popular routes on Mont Blanc in 2022, 
          this is not resolving their rescue problem caused by undereducated, overconfident people)
          |
          a likely outcome for this permit system is increasing popularity of big in-a-day climbs
          this style of climbing is incredibly risky, even when undertaken by pro-level climbers
          a large increase in popularity of speed climbing has potentially huge negative implications
          huge future potential for speed climbing to become popular with under or mis-educated masses 
          this could cause a much larger strain on rescue resources than big wall climbing ever has

                what does building and funding a hoverboard look like irl
  todo: 
  - check on e-ink license plate with people
  - smart grant
  - vidya game make an outline, storyline, concepts etc see if your writer frien is interested in helping

          - irl we really want the ion drive to work in atmosphere, and we need battery stuff to change dramatically
          - the sound-based battery system could work very well if we can get it out of the ocean / scale
          - am not a physicist so actually working on that myself is not really ideal?
          - will, if necessary. go to school?  would be better to have money to throw at physicists
          - something like the SMART grant would help
          - two ideas
          - 1 not that useful maybe but e-ink license plate. only legal in three states, but new. should be an easy sell
          - 2 floating load delivery platform proof of concept
          - - basically just a flat drone to push boxes around on
          - - could be self-guided eventually, main goal is have it respond to touch input
          - - so push on a side, it goes that direction
          - - compensates automatically to not tip when you push, etc.
          - - trying to build a scale model proof of concept, to move a scale load in the way a forklift typically does
          - - this inital product would then be roughly a forklift the size of a pallet, hopefully charged long enough to unload a truck
          - - remote user input to raise a load up into storage safely as an individual
          - - powered battery base that responds to the same usable touch input so the platform can charge in use unless flying
          - * e-ink license plate could probably be kickstarted with a render
          - - - this is a great side project that could mean big money
          - - - see if people are excited.  if an industrial designer chose to invest a little time this could happen quick
          - * side scroller game could be a fun way to build interest and make some side money
          - - start with jank battery powered drone hoverboard
          - - work up to ion drive, infinite power
          - - add in other cool things like the flying car, bike, home etc.
          - - like alto meets hill climb
          - - minimal ads, like alto
          - - store with merch etc
          - - early release a hoverboard through the game one day ;)
          - * something something floating carbon fiber cadillac luxury camper home
          - - like, its a whole new world baby
          - have enough knowledge to build some version of the drone thing, have an industrial designer to help with packaging
          - could probably get both of those ideas done without too much third party input?
          - we need third party input for the cool stuff.  if we can fund a feasibility report from MIT guys about the ion drive and sound based battery
          - that would be cool and tell us enough to either get big funding or sit on the idea
          -
          - blah blah future this could be a floating platform that cleans the air and is powered by sound what do you want
          - yes, flying surfboard
          - yes, flying car
          - your jetsons house is still kinda dumb
          - yes, floating moss hut

  todo:
  - smart grant
  - model platform w/drone parts
  - define and code movement software based on skate, snow, surf, ski
  - consider traditional load carrying ideas ie. dogsled, kayak, skid etc
  - build a working protoype drone you can fly with pressure from your hand
  - make it tinyyy
  - sell it as a modern tech deck
  - pile money
  - research ion drive
  - research sound-based power
  - make a toy that does that
  - repeat the sell and profit steps
  - make it bigger
  - fly a cadillac
  - fly your cadillac to your floating rainforest moss island with the bear and falcon
  - feel accomplished and probably chill
